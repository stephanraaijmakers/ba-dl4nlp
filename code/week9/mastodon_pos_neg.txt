Too bad I am extremely lazy and probably won't have this done for a few more days due to procrastination . #Art #Lovely #Order <URL>	0
Hope you get around to it ,	1

I've mentioned this system before , but I can't get over how awesome the Holborn series lookedThis is the 6100 and 9120 ( pic with the lady ) and it's so Fallout !	1
Good eye ! But it was a floor standing computer , not a desktop	1
jeez , that was fast .	1
So possibly a set piece to look futuristic based on the desktop one .	1
Ah , I was right ! It definitely was the arcade game . Here's more info on the exact model they redressed <URL>	1
that is wonderful . I love how they stuck a full TV in that cabinet instead of just the CRT	1
It's a pretty old trick , but considering the tech of the day , it was very cleverAlso , " modern " series were doing the same thingHere's a scene from StarTrek Voyager where you can clearly see the mouse cursor in the " LCARS " . Didn't know they still had mouse cursors in 2371 ;)	1
especially on a touch screen ,	1
this website is very confusing .	0

There is nothing worse than an airport with a closed Pre ‚úÖ lineFlocks of grown humans with no idea what " laptops out of your bags " and " shoes must be removed " means . I grabbed 8 bins because I correctly guessed 4 of them would go to others ahead of me in line #KSJC	0
The last time I was at KSJC they'd given up all pretense of post -9/11 security and were keeping laptops in bags and waving folks through metal detectors with shoes on . It was wonderful .	1
this was not one of those times Nice airport tbh , just bummed that the airport bar is closed and my airplane is broken and I'm gonna sober up before they get a replacement aircraft in	0
The plane is broken and the bar is closed ?	0
That's some Grade A bullshit right there .	0
Sorry fox .	0
I'm a cat , you inconsiderate clod ! = ^ . ^ = ... I think they're going to keep trying to start that engine manually until another 737 arrives in a half hour and we move over to that	0
Good luck with - finally - getting on flight , too !	1
I'm very down ... I haven't read any good sci fi in awhile	0
if you don't want to wait AnonNomF AnonNomG writes great hard scifi . AnonNomF AnonNomG has good depictions of post-internet technology and AnonNomH AnonNomI helped me sort out plot points in my big fiction work	1
there is tons of good scifi right now actually , maybe we can push this in next book club while awaiting providence	1
It is lovely .	1
I'm designing knitting patterns to represent the main characters , that's how much I enjoy it .	1
that's a recommendation fs , I will have a look ! Now I have to try to attack my massive backlog not to mention finish our book club book üòÖ	1
in my case , yes ,	1
all of it actually	1
I'm agreement with CP . Use of Weapons I liked more than Player of Games though .	1
I think I like mostly any of them where he reins in his desire to write hundreds of pages about things that are Very Big blowing up Very Spectacularly	1
yeah that's fair .	1
I think I'm more interested in explorations of the Culture than hard action	1
It's more pure than just a plain black shirt tbh	1
Indiana unfortunately üòî	0
because it sucks . Our state has the largest percentage of T * * * p supporters and there's literally nothing here lol	0
Most of the midwest is rural and the rural population is uneducated redneck white folk .	0
so they're still rocking with him ? after all that's happened since he took office ?	0
yes and on top of that , they refuse any factual evidence against him because their entire lineage are republican loyalists .	0
I'm getting back into KSP career mode and it's a lot of fun , especially with more difficulty settings on ( like plasma blackouts and G-force limits ) .	1

I'll definitely check it out !	1
Let's make tomorrow rock .	1
I'll vote for that !	1
semi official shuttering of the academy ?	0
NEVER I'm just awful at remembering things	0

AnonNameS guy has a neat short manga about some weird horror story guy ( Good Stuff ) and AnonNameR guy has a Sadly Discontinued really good one called AnonNameT zoo , if ur interested tho ( u can find both on mangafox )	1
So I'm honestly real fucking happy that the federated timeline mostly seems to be a bunch of suuuper bitter anarchists . My people .	1
( Perhaps I should hop to the instance that's like , specifically about that ? )	1
Best part is ‚Äî you can do both !	1
I keep going back and forth between finding it super irritating and super funny .	0
Someone tell me how to feel !	0
on one hand , it seems petty . on the other hand , i experience a reflexive fear that commonly referring to the fediverse in the language of commoditization is the first step in it somehow becoming birdsite	0
disgusted prompto pictures i have <URL> <URL> <URL> <URL>	0

i hate this app	0
unfortunately like . almost all are east asian based . :(	0
When will my fellow East Asians let anyone else at the media cake , honestly .	0
I get that we're still only getting a sliver of the whole thing , but it would still be better to also give literally any other Asian groups opportunities , too .	0
yeah it's like SO obvious too like i genuinely was trying to think of se / s asian actors in hollywood and u can really only think of the Big Names while there r a good # of east asians , i mean it's bad for all of us , but even more so for not east asians .	0
this happens when u think about it you fool	0

the shitposting is real	0
well , both federated and local lol like what is even going on	0
You gotta start following people who toot this late at night lol . It works .	1

so i started rewatching the office in the evenings while i work and it's so painful . JIM . PAM . JUST DO IT .	0
my tolerance for awkwardness humor is low ( and not getting better ) ... I find " The Office " almost unwatchable	0
yeah . so awkward . it's very painful	0
do people actually enjoy TV about , well , unpleasant people ?	0
I guess I do , sometimes , but seriously I get my fill of people being petty and vindictive in my daily life	0
See , the thing is that there are enough pleasant people that it strings you along ( for certain values of " you " )	0
mheh , well said ! and you put your finger right on it , Jim and Pam are supposed to be those people for us , but after a while they just look insufferable too	0
yeah , I kind of stopped watching at some point when it was on because I couldn't deal with it anymore .	0
I mean , before Jim and Pam are together , you have that they really have to bone at some point . After they're together , why endure ?	0
I dread every time I open whatsapp on my phone . Having anxiety about everything is some tiresome business .	0
anxiety , you say , what is this aaaanxieeetyyy ... üòÖ	0

but I don't like it here . I want to go back .	0
I really wonder why Beelzebub doesn't have 2nd season ?	0
nope sadly it doesn't , also anime stopped following manga after 49 episodes so rest 11 episodes are fillers ,	0
but still it's one of my favourite delinquent based anime üòÜ üòÜ	1
that's why I felt confusion when I compare the manga to the Anime . I really wonder Why it was desperately forced to end that badly . üò≠ üò≠ üò≠	0
I was to disappointed by watching the end , then someone said me anime didn't follow the manga so there's no chance of 2nd season . Damn I wonder why such things happen with amazing animes ..	0
when I read it in the net , most if there comments said that because the anime is more on violence that's why theres no chance of having a second season . I wonder why it only happens to beelzebub üò≠ üò≠	0
nah that's not the reason , just think that anime doesn't follow the manga and adds it's own story and fillers , makes no sense ,	0
so what do you think they'll show in 2nd season ?	0
and sadly I love this anime as it's the best delinquent based anime xD .	1
very well said ! In short , just made as dissapoint ! I really expect more towards this anime üò≠ üò≠	0
yeah exactly , well it's rare to see a delinquent raising a baby , and it's not ordinary baby though üòÇ üòÇ	0
A snow leopard sphynx ( sans wings , ooops ) for AnonNameZ on twitter as part of the AnonNameW ( also on twitter ) . I ‚Äô d love to take this to paper one day when I ‚Äô m feeling a little more confident - gotta buckle down on capturing atmosphere more often !	1
DANG I love the intensity of her expression in the sketch ! ! Sphinxes are the best	1
should I post some of my old ones ?	1
i never mentioned this but my character in dragon D & D is a beautiful genderfluid bronze dragon . her favored humanoid form is that of a sailor man ( actually in her back story she was a fisherman but i always refer to her as a buff sailor ) . i love her	1
omg I love the idea of a genderfluid shape-changer so much !	1

okay , how do people who don't have VC money pouring out their ears put up with this ?	0
like , tools exist to manage bare metal and nocix gives you a much better deal	0
nocix and aws aren't even the same species . you can't really compare them like that .	0

i don't have the budget to do anything like that , so not the place for me to be lookin ' . :/	0
Yup .	0
And probably not all the time and patience it takes to write and maintain the kind of obnoxious software necessary to run such an environment . God knows I don't	0
... apparently I'm at that level of emotional corniness where the DS9 theme plays on shuffle and I start crying	0
Yes ,	0
but have you ever burst into tears during a Richard Simmons tape after he chirps " I love you ! " to the camera ? ( But seriously I was pretty bummed when DS9 ended because THOSE ARE ALL MY FRIENDS , GUYS . ) #criesatparadefloats	0
